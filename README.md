# Machine Learning Library

The Machine Learning Library hosts my code base for the various Machine Learning exercises and the real world problems that I have solved and completed as part of my work on Practical Machine Learning. 

## The Repository

The repository for Machine Learning is like a folder or storage space that contains all the files such as code, documentation, images, and more related to real-world machine learning problems. It also tracks every change that I or my team makes to each file. 

It is always possible go back to previous versions of we make any mistakes.

So, feel free, be more human, to make mistakes and to learn from them.
